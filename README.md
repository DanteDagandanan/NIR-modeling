# NIR-modeling
This code performs data preprocessing and feature selection for a dataset of near-infrared (NIR) spectra of jackfruit, with the target variable being the total soluble solids (TSS) content. The preprocessing steps include dropping null values, performing spectral correction techniques (multiplicative scatter correction and Savitzky-Golay filtering), and grouping the data by TSS level and calculating the mean and standard deviation for each group. The code then plots the spectra and displays a table showing the mean and standard deviation for each TSS level for the raw, Savitzky-Golay, and MSC spectra. Next, the code performs feature selection using the standard deviation of the spectral data for each TSS level, and trains several regression models (PLSR, RF, SVR, MLP, and AutoKeras) using the selected features. Finally, the code evaluates the performance of each model using mean squared error and R-squared metrics.
